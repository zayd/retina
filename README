Project to implement network that learns retina's log-polar tiling of retinal ganglion cells

* To Do
x Done

Critical
[*] - Pixel list to array method
[*] - inference based reconstruction (show log-polar vs. uniform sampling)
[*] - information theoretic argument with (log-polar vs uniform)
[*] - optimize inference based reconstruction

Nice Things

[*] - computer covariance matrix using cython?
[*] - optimize saliency map
[*] - fix noise: SNR?
[x] - fix parameters of log lattice
[*] - better way to move gaze

Future
[*] - non simple receptive fields
