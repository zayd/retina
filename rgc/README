Implementation of Karklin & Simoncelli 2011 non-linearity + noise network

* To Do 
x Done

Critical
[x] - Use rectifying function nonlinearity
[*] - Learn updates for G matrix (how does it affect parameters - taylor series expansion, update first order)
  [x] - Update for a 
  [*] - Update for b... weird.
[*] - Fix theano to compute update in function
[*] - Add time convolution
[*] - Use Van Haateran Images - get it to learn center surrounds. Requires 
[*] - Optical Blur Computation (or anything that changes objective function - need to see how sensitive it). Possibly a term for different l1 penalties based on where RGC RF is  
[*] - Experiment with pre-whitened images and higher level of overcompleteness

Nice 
[*] - Allow updates to G matrix over all M (instead of separtely near line 70-74)

Future
[*] - Use pseudoinverse of C_x to use higher dimensions
